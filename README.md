# MyBudget - Made by Oceanida

WARNING: This is a work made for a an School application, any company names, characters, places and incidents either are products of the author's imagination or are used fictitiously.

##### Description

The present application has been made for following the instructions of a statement proposed by our teacher. The main idea we had to follow is sentenced by the following points:

1. The application needs to have a cognitive tracking of the transactions that are made by the user.
2. The main screen has to show in all the time, the total balance of the budget. In case that the total balance is negative, it has to been shown in red.
3. The user needs the poisibility to add a new budget, that can be considerated an 'Income' or an 'Expense'
4. All the registered movements need a Description, Amount, Date and Id. In this application, the first two are needed to introduce for creating a new budget, the date in case of not selecting it, will be placed with the current one.
5. The movements list (that one that will have the transactions) has to be implemented the most efficiency as possible, allowing the user to delete items. Sadly, this application (currently), doesnt allow to update the values, but it has a button for it prepared (it has a console.log that warns its malfunctioning).
6. There will be a Constants folder, including the styleSheet with the theme of the application.
